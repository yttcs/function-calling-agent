## Barebones function calling agent using the following technology: 

1. Backend: FastAPI, SQL Model, OpenAI completions API, Tavily Search API
2. Frontend: Jinja2, Bootstrap, FetchAPI
3. Security: Oauth2 with password flow using JWT bearer tokens and a remote MariaDB user identity database hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS.

This is a work in progress and it's planned to have multiple updates on a weekly basis.

### Update for week of Jun. 30, 2025:

1. Added multiuser capability
2. Added Tavily Extract API
3. Switched LLMs to gpt-4o because gpt-3.5-turbo context length token limit is too restrictive.
