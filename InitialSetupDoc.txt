Make sure you have python or python3 within visual studio code

pip should be installed by default 

if not  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

then run pip install -r requirements.txt when you're in the root directory

you may need to install  -m pip install pymysql and tavily-python

after you need to obtain the api key from tavily

for windows setx TAVILY_API_KEY "{API KEY HERE}" within environmental user variables along with the OPENAI_API_KEY

pip install uvicorn[standard] run main.py

the web browser will be something along the lines of 127.0.0.1.8000 and use the endpoints to switch to the proper route to debug

next would be to pip install passlib[bcrypt] so you can register properly with a hashed and salted password

uvicorn main:app --reload to launch the web browser
